      <p>Art has long been a male-dominated field, a legacy that museums are only recently beginning to address.
        With a collection of 200,000 artworks, Statens Museum for Kunst (SMK) in Copenhagen offers a rich dataset for exploring how these imbalances persist within institutional collections. Through the freely available SMK API, this project analyzes and visualizes artist and artwork metadata to investigate patterns of gender representation in the museum's collection.

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>SMK Data Visualized is an interactive data exploration tool that analyzes gender representation in the
          collection of Denmark's National Gallery of Art (Statens Museum for Kunst). Using the museum's <a
            href="https://www.smk.dk/article/smk-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public API</a>,
          this application processes nearly 200,000 artworks to reveal patterns in institutional collecting practices,
          artist demographics, and curatorial decisions across time.</p>
        <p>The project presents 18 distinct visualization sections examining artist demographics, temporal acquisition
          patterns, geographic distribution, physical characteristics, color analysis, subject matter, and institutional
          visibility. Through statistical analysis and interactive charts, it makes complex museum collection data
          accessible and transparent, encouraging informed dialogue about representation in cultural institutions.</p>

        <h3>About Statens Museum for Kunst (SMK)</h3>

        <h3>Technology & Open Source</h3>
        <p>This is a client-side web application built with modern JavaScript (ES6 modules), Chart.js,
          and D3.js. All data processing happens in your browser. The application
          uses IndexedDB for optional local caching (with your consent) to improve performance on repeat visits.</p>
        <p>The complete source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/victornordquist/SMK-Data-Visualized"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> under an open source license. Contributions, suggestions, and
          feedback are welcome.</p>

        <h3>Gender Classification</h3>
        <p><strong>How gender is determined:</strong> Gender is based on the <code>creator_gender</code> field in the
          SMK API, which reflects the museum's cataloguing. Values are normalized to "Male", "Female", or "Unknown".
          For depicted persons in artworks (portraits, etc.), gender is extracted from the
          <code>content_person_full</code>
          field when available.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Assumptions & Scope</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One creator per work:</strong> Only the primary creator's gender is analyzed. Collaborative
            works are attributed to the first listed creator.</li>
          <li><strong>Acquisition patterns:</strong> Acquisition dates reveal institutional collecting priorities over time.
            The analysis includes temporal trends, recent patterns, and the lag between artwork creation
            and museum acquisition. Note that donations and bequests may not reflect active curatorial choices.</li>
          <li><strong>Current API snapshot:</strong> Display status, exhibition counts, and digitization status reflect
            the current state of the database, not historical patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Geographical analysis:</strong> Geographic data is based on artist birth countries and depicted
            locations from the API. Not all artworks have complete geographic metadata.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visualization & Analysis Methods</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sample sizes shown in tooltips:</strong> All percentage-based charts include actual counts in
            hover tooltips (e.g., "Female: 15.2% (23 of 151 works)") to help assess the reliability of percentages.</li>
          <li><strong>Percentages on small samples:</strong> Interpret with caution. Charts may show high percentages
            based on very few artworks.</li>
          <li><strong>Median vs. Average:</strong> For geographic distance analysis ("Distance from home"), median
            distances are reported instead of averages to provide robust comparisons not skewed by outliers (e.g.,
            artworks depicting Greenland). When averages differ significantly from medians (>200km), both measures are
            shown with explanatory notes about outliers.</li>
          <li><strong>Trend analysis (linear regression):</strong> The 50-year female acquisition trend (1975-2025)
            uses linear regression to visualize long-term patterns. Insights compare the first 25 years (1975-1999)
            against the last 25 years (2000-2025) to assess progress.</li>
          <li><strong>Color categorization (Traditional Color Wheel):</strong> Artwork colors are classified using the
            traditional color wheel structure based on HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) analysis:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Primary colors (3):</strong> Red, Yellow, Blue</li>
              <li><strong>Secondary colors (3):</strong> Orange, Green, Purple</li>
              <li><strong>Tertiary colors (6):</strong> Red-Orange, Yellow-Orange, Yellow-Green, Blue-Green, Blue-Violet,
                Red-Violet</li>
            </ul>
            Timeline charts show only these 12 chromatic colors (achromatic colors like black, white, and gray are excluded
            to highlight chromatic trends). Treemaps show the top 100 actual hex colors by frequency. Color data is extracted
            from the <code>colors</code> field in the API, which contains hex color codes representing dominant colors in each
            artwork's image.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Diverging bar charts:</strong> Used for nationality comparisons where bars extend left (male) and
            right (female) from a central axis, making gender differences visually intuitive.</li>
          <li><strong>Sankey diagrams:</strong> Used to visualize flow relationships (e.g., departments to object
            types) with thickness representing volume of artworks.</li>
          <li><strong>World maps & geographic visualization:</strong> Artist birth countries and depicted locations are
            mapped using D3.js with TopoJSON data. Distance calculations use the Haversine formula with Copenhagen
            (SMK location) as reference point.</li>
          <li><strong>Treemaps for color palette:</strong> Show top 100 colors as rectangles sized by frequency,
            displaying actual hex color codes for larger cells. Hover tooltips show color, count, and percentage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Statistical Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No significance testing:</strong> This is exploratory data analysis. Observed differences are
            not tested for statistical significance. Patterns should be interpreted as descriptive, not inferential.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Temporal aggregation:</strong> Many charts aggregate by decade (e.g., birth years, acquisition
            dates) to reveal patterns while smoothing year-to-year noise.</li>
          <li><strong>Percentage calculations:</strong> Percentages are calculated within each category (e.g., "% of
            male artists' works" vs "% of female artists' works"), not as overall collection percentages, unless
            otherwise noted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Quality & Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Missing metadata:</strong> Not all artworks have complete information. Fields like
            <code>creator_gender</code>, <code>production_year</code>, <code>dimensions</code>, <code>colors</code>,
            and geographic data may be incomplete.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Cataloguing practices:</strong> Gender classification reflects museum cataloguing practices,
            which may have evolved over time and may not capture all nuances of identity.</li>
          <li><strong>Historical bias in data:</strong> The data reflects historical collecting practices and may
            perpetuate historical biases in representation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Anomalies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Peaks in 1787 and 1887:</strong> The museum's database was established in 1887. Artworks with
            unknown acquisition dates were recorded as acquired "before 1887." In a later database version, this was
            interpreted as a 100-year interval (1787-1887). The data extraction process assigns these to specific
            years (1787 or 1887), creating artificial peaks. These represent artworks acquired before 1887 where the
            exact year is unknown.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Performance & Caching</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GDPR-compliant storage:</strong> The application uses browser IndexedDB to cache API data for
            improved performance, with user consent required (cookie expires after 365 days).</li>
          <li><strong>Cache duration:</strong> Cached data expires after 30 days. Users can manually refresh via the
            "Refresh Data" button.</li>
          <li><strong>Lazy loading:</strong> Below-the-fold charts are loaded on-demand as users scroll to improve
            initial page load time.</li>
        </ul>
