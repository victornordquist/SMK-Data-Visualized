      <p>Art has historically been a male-dominated field, but museums are today increasingly addressing the gender gap
        through various efforts. With more than 200,000 artworks, Statens Museum for Kunst (SMK) in Copenhagen provides
        a rich
        dataset to explore. Through the freely available SMK API, this project analyzes and visualizes both artist and
        artwork
        metadata to examine gender disparity in the SMK collection.

        <h2 id="methodology-heading">Methodology & Data Limitations</h2>

        <h3>Creator</h3>
        <p>Victor Nordquist</p>

        <h3>Data Source</h3>
        <p>All data is fetched from the <a href="https://www.smk.dk/article/smk-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMK
            API</a>. The dataset is also used for <a href="https://open.smk.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMK
            Open</a>.
          This analysis includes only artworks with recorded acquisition dates.</p>

        <h3>Gender Classification</h3>
        <p><strong>How gender is determined:</strong> Gender is based on the <code>creator_gender</code> field in the
          SMK API, which reflects the museum's cataloguing. Values are normalized to "Male", "Female", or "Unknown".
        </p>

        <h3>Key Assumptions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One creator per work:</strong> Only the primary creator's gender is analyzed. Collaborative
            works are attributed to the first listed creator.</li>
          <li><strong>Acquisition date = museum interest:</strong> I use acquisition dates as a proxy for
            institutional collecting priorities, though donations and bequests may not reflect active curatorial
            choices.</li>
          <li><strong>Current API snapshot:</strong> Display status and exhibition counts reflect the current state of
            the database, not historical patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Statistical Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No significance testing:</strong> This is exploratory data analysis. Observed differences are
            not tested for statistical significance.</li>
          <li><strong>Sample sizes (n=) are shown</strong> throughout to help assess reliability of percentages.</li>
          <li><strong>Percentages on small samples</strong> should be interpreted with caution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Anomalies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Peaks in 1787 and 1887:</strong> The museum's database was established in 1887. Artworks with
            unknown acquisition dates were recorded as acquired "before 1887." In a later database version, this was
            interpreted as a 100-year interval (1787-1887). The data extraction process assigns these to specific
            years (1787 or 1887), creating artificial peaks. These represent artworks acquired before 1887 where the
            exact year is unknown.</li>
        </ul>
